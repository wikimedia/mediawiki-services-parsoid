0.11.0 / 2019-12-20
===================
This is the LAST release of (the JS implementation of) Parsoid. Parsoid has been
ported from JS to PHP and will be more closely integrated into MediaWiki and will
not need its own debian package henceforth.

This release contains the entire working port of Parsoid to PHP, but we are not
providing any support for this setup. By the next release of MediaWiki, Parsoid
will be better integrated there and will be available as part of MediaWiki.

  Notable changes
  * Parsoid HTML version bumped to 2.1.0
  * Code cleanup
    - Use ES6 class syntax with one class export per file
    - Removed dead code
    - Removed most uses of .bind()
    - Removed circular dependencies
    - Replaced promises with async/yield in most places in the codebase
  * Language converter
    - Bulk of the code moved out of Parsoid into its own repo
    - Crimean Tatar, zh language converters added
  * Code improvements
    - Extract a token transform interface that individual handlers implement
    - Extract a DOMHandler interface for html2wt DOM handlers
  * Move media info code to a post-processing batch pass to eliminate
    imageinfo API requests during token processing
  * Move data out of DOM nodes into a bag-on-the-side
  * Eliminate serialize/parse of JSON data attributes when tree building
  * Move redlink and language converter code into lib/parse.js - Parsoid's
    entry point class
  * Use wikipeg (our erstwhile pegjs fork) native rule parameters and get rid of
    our homegrown stop/flag stacks and update PEG grammar
  * Ensure protocol-relative URLs are used for media
  * A number of bug fixes during the port of Parsoid from JS to PHP

    This now translates empty lines entered in VE to empty lines in wikitext

  * Removed &lt; node v6 compatibility
  * Migrate to jsdoc instead of jsduck for documentation
  * Allow users to dynamically configure new wikis
  * Addressed nsp-triggered security advisories

    - Test for a valid protocol before attempting to tokenize extlink content
    - Ensure ref.cachedHtml isn't being regenerated needlessly
    - Suppress autoInsertedEnd flags where not required

  Cleanup:
  * Split up large utility classes into smaller functional groups

  * Lint multiple colon escaped links (incorrect usage)
  * Add an API endpoint to get lint errors for wikitext
  * Turn off ignored-table-attr output
  * Add detection for several wikitext patterns that render differently
