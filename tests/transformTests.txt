# This is the Transformer unit test file that works with transformerTests.js
# Each type of transformer/hander is specified using ':' followed
# by the transformer name, for example, ": QuoteTransformer" and
# is ended when a new transformer is specified, such as ": ListHandler"
# Tests are specified by using '!' which precedes the test description.
# Input tokens are recognized as either a list '{' with a "type"
# or just any characters for text tokens. If the first character on a
# line is '[' then the following array of list items specifies
# the desired result to compare against and ends the current test.
#
# To execute this test, choose a transformer such as ListHandler and
# the from the command line in the parsoid directory, type:
# $ node bin/transformerTest.js --manual --ListHandler --inputFile tests/transformerTests.txt
#
# Only the ListHandler section will be processed and report passed or failed tests
