/**
 * Interface for collecting the results of a parse.
 *
 * This class is used by Parsoid to record metainformation about a
 * particular bit of parsed content which is extracted during the
 * parse.  This includes (for example) table of contents information,
 * and lists of links/categories/templates/images present in the
 * content.  Expected cache lifetime of this parsed content is also
 * recorded here, as it is influenced by certain things which may
 * be encountered during the parse.
 *
 * In core this is implemented by ParserOutput.  Core uses
 * ParserOutput to record the rendered HTML (and rendered table of
 * contents HTML), but on the Parsoid side we're going to keep
 * rendered HTML DOM out of this interface (we use PageBundle for
 * this).

interface ContentMetadataCollector {
	/*
	 * Internal implementation notes:
	 * This class was refactored out of ParserOutput in core.
	 *
	 * == Deliberately omitted ==
	 * ::get*()/::has*() and other getters
	 *   This is a builder-only interface.  This also avoids ordering
	 *   issues if/when Parsoid passes this class to sub-parses/extensions.
	 * ::setSpeculativeRevIdUsed()
	 * ::setRevisionTimestampUsed()
	 * ::setRevisionUsedSha1Base36()
	 * ::setSpeculativePageIdUsed()
	 *   T292865: these should be plumbed through direct from ParserOptions
	 *   or use the ::setOutputFlag() or addOutputData() mechanism.
	 * ::setTimestamp()
	 *   This is used by ParserCache and is a little optimization used to
	 *   show the correct 'article was last edited on blablablah' box on
	 *   page views.  Parsoid shouldn't need to worry about this; probably
	 *   part of T292865.
	 * ::addCacheMessage()
	 *   This is marked @internal in core.
	 *   Not clear yet whether Parsoid needs this.
	 * ::getText()/::setText()
	 *   T293512: rendered HTML doesn't belong in ParserOutput
	 * ::addWrapperDivClass()/::clearWrapperDivClass()
	 *   Has to do with ::getText() implementation, see above
	 * ::setTitleText()
	 *   Omited because it contains rendered HTML
	 *   (should become a method which takes a DOM tree instead?)
	 * ::setTOCHTML()
	 *   Omitted because it contains rendered HTML.
	 *   T293513 will remove this method from ParserOutput
	 * ::addHeadItem()
	 *   Not clear this is needed by Parsoid (but maybe some of the stuff
	 *   Parsoid adds to head could be refactored to use this interface).
	 *   Should be DOM not string data!
	 * ::addOutputPageMetadata()
	 *   OutputPage isn't a Parsoid interface, so this shouldn't be needed
	 *   by Parsoid.
	 * ::setDisplayTitle()
	 *   T293514: This desugars to calls to two other methods in
	 *   ContentOutputBuilder; callers can refactor to invoke those directly.
	 * ::unsetPageProperty()
	 *   If parse fragment A is setting a property
	 *   and parse fragment B is unsetting the property, we've introduced
	 *   an ordering dependency. We'd like to avoid that code pattern.
	 * ::resetParseStartTime()/::getTimeSinceStart()
	 *   Not needed by parsoid?
	 * ::finalizeAdaptiveCacheExpiry()
	 *   Same as above, can probably be invoked by caller of parsoid,
	 *   doesn't need to be in Parsoid library code.
	 * ::mergeInternalMetaDataFrom()
	 * ::mergeHtmlMetaDataFrom()
	 * ::mergeTrackingMetaDataFrom()
	 *   Rather than explicitly merging ContentMetadataCollectors, we'd
	 *   prefer to pass a single ContentOutputBuilder around to accumulate
	 *   results.  We're going to wait and see to what extent methods like
	 *   this are necessary.
	 *   (ParserOutput will implement a ::mergeTo(ContentMetadataCollector)
	 *   method, as it has read access to its own contents.)
	 * ::setNoGallery()/::setEnableOOUI()/::setNewSection()/::setHideNewSection()
	 * ::setPreventClickjacking()/::setIndexPolicy()/
	 *   Available via ::setOutputFlag() (see T292868)
	 * ::setCategories()
	 *   Doesn't seem necessary, we have ::addCategory().
	 *   (And adding the ability to overwrite categories would be bad.)
	 * ::addTrackingCategory()
	 *   This was moved to Parser / the TrackingCategories service, and
	 *   equivalently DataAccess in Parsoid.
	 * ::isLinkInternal()
	 *   T296036: Should be non-public or at least @internal?
	 * ::addInterwikiLink()
	 *   invoked from ::addLink() if the link is external, we don't
	 *   need a separate entry point.
	 * ::setSections()
	 *   T296025: replaced with ::setTOCData()
	 * ::setLanguageLinks()
	 *   Deprecated; replaced with ::addLanguageLink()
	 * ::addExtraCSPDefaultSrc()
	 * ::addExtraCSPStyleSrc()
	 * ::addExtraCSPScriptSrc()
	 * ::updateRuntimeAdaptiveExpiry()
	 *   T296345: handled through ::appendOutputStrings()
	 *
	 * == Temporarily omitted ==
	 * ::addTemplate()
	 *   T296038: Requires page id and revision id.  In addition, this
	 *   interacts with user hooks.  The MediaWiki side should probably be
	 *   responsible for updating the Template dependencies not Parsoid.
	 *   OTOH, we need to return *something* like a Title back because
	 *   eventually Parsoid has to fetch the template to expand it.
	 * ::setTitleText()
	 *   T293514: This contains the title in HTML and is redundant with
	 *   ::setDisplayTitle()

	 * the pages with a certain property (the "presence" of the
	 * property is also indexed; see Special:PagesWithProp,
	 * list=pageswithprop).
	 *
	 * The page property is stored in the page_props database
	 * table. The page_props table is a key-value store indexed by the
	 * page ID. This allows the parser to set a property on a page
	 * whose value can then be quickly retrieved given the page ID or via a
	 * DB join when given the page title.  The page_props table is *also*
	 * indexed on the numeric sort key passed as $numericValue to this
	 * method. This allows for efficient "top k" queries of pages with
	 * respect to a given property.
	 *
	 * In the future, we may allow the value to be specified independent
	 * of sort key (T357783).
	 *
	 * The setNumericPageProperty() method is thus used to propagate
	 * properties from the parsed page to request contexts other than
	 * a page view of the currently parsed article.
	 *
	 * Some applications examples:
	 *
	 *   * The Proofread page extension stores
	 *     `proofread_page_quality_level` as a numeric property to allow
	 *     efficient retrieval of pages of a certain quality level.
	 *
	 *   * Keeping a count of the number of errors found in a page property
	 *     to allow listing pages in order from most errors to least.
	 *
	 * If you need a placeholder value, you likely should be using
	 * ::setUnsortedPageProperty() instead.
	 *
	 * @note Note that the PageProp service always returns strings
	 *  for the value of the page property, while values retrieved
	 *  from this ParserOutput will be numeric.  Be careful to distinguish
	 *  these two cases.
	 *
	 * @note Do not use setNumericPageProperty() to set a property
	 * which is only used in a context where the ParserOutput object
	 * itself is already available, for example a normal page
	 * view. There is no need to save such a property in the database
	 * since the text is already parsed; use ::setExtensionData()
	 * instead.

	 * @code
	 *    $parser->getOutput()->setExtensionData( 'my_ext_foo', '...' );
