This is a "virtual" namespace, used for the particular DOM implementation
Parsoid is choosing to use.

The default implementation here uses the subclassing mechanism built
into PHP's \DOMDocument and \Dom\Document classes.  It is intended
that the implementation in `Wikimedia\Dodo` (or some other DOM
implementation) can also be aliased into this namespace.  The overall
goal is to provide a measure of implementation independence by
ensuring that direct references to the built-in \DOM* classes don't
appear in type hints and phan docs.
